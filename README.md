This project is a custom-built, lightweight interpreter written in Python for a simple scripting language.

It includes a robust Lexer based on regular expressions and a recursive-descent Parser that evaluates mathematical expressions with correct operator precedence (multiplication and division before addition and subtraction).

The interpreter supports:
- Variable assignment using the `SET` keyword
- Arithmetic expressions with parentheses
- String literals and string concatenation
- Real-time output via a custom `SHOW()` function

This project demonstrates hands-on implementation of core computer science concepts such as **lexical analysis**, **syntactic parsing**, **expression evaluation**, and **memory management** using a global variable state.
